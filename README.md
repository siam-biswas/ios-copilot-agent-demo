### 🟦 Prompt 1: MVVM + JSON-Powered Country List

🔧 Modify the iOS app to use the MVVM architecture to display a list of countries. Load country data from a bundled local JSON file, with each item showing the name, capital, and ISO country code.

**🚀 Copilot’s Assist**:
- Generated `Country` model and decoding logic.
- Helped structure the `ViewModel` to load from the bundle.
- Suggested optimized SwiftUI binding for the list view.

**🧱 What Was Built**:
- `Country` model (`Identifiable`, `Decodable`)
- `CountryListViewModel` for data loading
- `ContentView` updated to display the list of countries

### 🟩 Prompt 3: Add Live Search Functionality

🔧 Add a search functionality to the country list screen so users can filter countries by name as they type. Ensure the search is case-insensitive and updates the displayed list in real time. Implement the search and filter logics inside ViewModel.

**🚀 Copilot’s Assist**:
- Helped implement `@Published` search text state.
- Suggested use of `Combine` for real-time updates.

**🔍 Result**:
- Users can filter countries instantly as they type.
- Search logic fully encapsulated in the `ViewModel`.

### 🟧 Prompt 4: Navigation to Country Details

🔧 Update the app to display country details when a user taps on a country in the list. Add a new 'details' field to the JSON to support this functionality. Implement selection logic inside View Model.

<img width="1512" alt="Prompt 4" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7121954-dee0-41f8-b00f-2ce064b9a140" />

**🚀 Copilot’s Assist**:
- Auto-updated the `Country` model with new field.
- Suggested use of `NavigationStack` and `NavigationLink`.
- Added selected country state in `ViewModel`.

**🧭 Result**:
- Seamless transition from list to detail.
- Detail screen dynamically displays extended info.

### 🟥 Prompt 5: Comprehensive Unit Testing for ViewModel

🔧 Add unit tests covering all functionalities of the view models, ensuring both positive and negative scenarios are tested for complete coverage. Update the view model implementation if needed to support the tests.

<img width="1512" alt="Prompt 5" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25775cdc-1a2d-4640-8fee-e83655cb6258" />

**🚀 Copilot’s Assist**:
- Generated test cases for data loading, search filtering, and selection.
- Refactored `ViewModel` to support the tests.

**🧪 Result**:
- All functionalities covered by tests.
- ViewModel logic robust and verified.
